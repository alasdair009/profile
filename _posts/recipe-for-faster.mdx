title: Recipe for Faster
description: The technology team at Jagex learned a lot from 2019 in our plans for the future of the web at Jagex. We made huge strides forwards with TypeScript, Node.js, Contentful and EJS for delivering web experiences. So, the stage was set to push forwards to grander ambitious projects and leverage new approaches to support the creative ambitions of our development teams.

# Animations

I use a variety of animations across my site. CSS animations are powerful tools but using them cleanly and consistently is essential.

It should also be possible to opt out of animations on a web page but maintain a consistent cognitive load (see prefers reduced motion below).

## Curves

Transitions and animations use timing curves to define the rate of change of animation. My site uses the following curves:

[//]: # '<CurveViewer curves={curves} title="curves" />'

## Prefers reduce motion

When the user has opted out of animations in their OS the website should respect this and remove any animation that it reasonably can.

To ensure this is honoured I have provided the following functions:

<Source
  language="css"
  code={`animation-duration: animation.animationDuration(1);`}
  dark={true}
/>

When using JavaScript to setup animations you can import the `prefersReducedMotion` boolean to easily check the user's preference.

<Source
  language="ts"
  code={`const animOptions = {duration: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 1s}`}
  dark={true}
/>

  <Paragraph>
    This Storybook instance serves as a playground for my front-end creativity
    and experiments. I strive to build everything you see here using CSS and SVG
    to create a lightweight and sleek user interface. While many visual effects
    can now be achieved with CSS, it’s important to remember that just because
    something is possible doesn’t mean it’s the best choice.

<Paragraph>
  I am driven by exploring how the web can be used to make the customer journey
  more inspiring whilst ensuring effectiveness. I love challenging the norms and
  testing new ideas to built the optimum solution.

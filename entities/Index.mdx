    This Storybook instance is a playground for all my front-end creativity and
    experiments. I try wherever possible to build everything in CSS and SVG to
    make the UI very light and slick. You will find that now most visual effects
    can be achieved in CSS but just remember just becuase you can does not mean
    you should!

      I hold a British Gymnastics Level 4 Performance Coach qualification in trampolining and a club coach qualification in coaching Double Mini Trampoline (DMT). Additionally I am also a county judge for trampoline having attended many competitions as both a competitor and official.

      I also have an interest in developing software to aid in education of trampoline gymnasts and coaches. I have a firm belief that the best information and coaching techniques should be available to all and not put behind arbitrary qualification or financial barriers.

      Over the years, I have had the pleasure of working with and being taught by some incredible talents in the trampoline world. There are probably more than I can remember to list here but those that are you have made an impact on my enjoyment of the greatest sport in the world.

        data-testid="UnorderedList"

      <li>
        <strong>
          Jane Macrae
        </strong>
        - my mother and (one of) my main coaches as a child. I now appreciate how difficult it is to teach your own offspring but hats off to you Mum!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Steve Locke
        </strong>
        - taken before his time, but was the kindest and most honourable person you could meet on a trampoline hall floor. It is a rare talent in trampolining to not fallout with anyone but this unsung hero was loved so much by so many (unless you needed to park your car in the sports centre disabled parking bays only to find them taken by Steve and his Ferrari).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Tamzin Reid
        </strong>
        - gave me the kick I needed to start taking coaching seriously. An instrumental presence on any coaching course and an incredible talent around a trampoline. I took many a grilling from her but I was a better coach for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Tony Hull
        </strong>
        - in the BG coaching world there are many Tonys (even on this list there are two). Tony Hull is another true gentlemen of a trampoline hall. He can explain complicated coaching methods in a way that could make anyone feel understand and included. I have had attended more coaching courses with Tony than probably any other tutor and they were all excellent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Jack Kelly
        </strong>
        - no list of trampoline heroes could not include the godfather of British Trampolining himself, Jack. I attended courses and workshops ran by him, and they were always superb. His famous (if not legendary) quotes will remain with me always. The twist truly is the easy bit!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Jay Scouler
        </strong>
        - in the present era of British Trampolining there are few bigger names than Jay. He was the tutor on my latest coaching course and there is no denying that Jay is one of the most talented coaches BG has ever produced. Like Tamzin, he is a presence in a gym hall, but the tough questions often help us to grow and improve our understanding. He always had the perfect answer to nearly any question for trampoline you could conjure - a truly outstanding coach.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Tony Fagelman
        </strong>
        - probably the man who has coached and mentored me more than anyone else. Tony took the scrappy 20-something year old I was to new heights and despite my slow ability to learn taught me skills I had been blocked on for years, and many more I never even dreamed of trying! I have been coached and coached along side him for over a decade and although we rarely occupy the hall at the same time these days, it is always a pleasure when we do.

      There are many many more coaches and clubs that have helped me over the years and I took a little something from all of you and always look back fondly!
